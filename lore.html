                        I'm obsessively curious. I can't see a mathematical
                        pattern without wanting to pull it apart and see if it
                        connects to something else. My work is a mix of rigorous
                        research (published on OEIS, presented at conferences)
                        and experimental coding projects where I just try
                        things. I think with whatever knowledge I have,
                        recombine ideas in weird ways, and occasionally stumble
                        onto something that works.
                        <br /><br />
                        I'm not just interested in solving known problems. I
                        want to

                        >. My north star is building things that are both
                        mathematically elegant and practically useful.

                        My journey into serious mathematical research began in
                        2022 with the
                        <strong>Probability in Regular 2-Polytopes</strong>
                        project. What started as curiosity about spatial
                        probability models evolved into a multi-year research
                        effort culminating in a conference presentation.
                        <br /><br />
                        This opened the door to discovering hidden patterns in
                        numbers - from OEIS contributions to finding π in the
                        integers. Each discovery reinforces my belief that

                        I'm working toward a future where mathematical elegance
                        meets practical AI systems. My research in number theory
                        and computational analysis isn't just about discovering
                        patterns - it's about

                        I believe the next breakthrough in deep learning
                        interpretability will come from unexpected places -
                        perhaps from the same mathematical structures that
                        connect integers to π, or from the convergence patterns
                        hidden in simple arithmetic operations.
